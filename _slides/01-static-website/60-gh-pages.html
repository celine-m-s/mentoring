## Going live

using Github

--

Github has a special feature to publish your website without buying a domain name or a server.

You will simply push your website on a new branch.

Github, you rock!

--

## Github branches

Like a timeline.

![]({% asset_path 60-gh-pages/gh-branches-1.png %})

--

Like a timeline in **parallel worlds**.

Need to do an experiment? Create a new world out of the first one.

![]({% asset_path 60-gh-pages/gh-branches-2.png %})

--

Then test everyting inside. What happens in this new branch stays in this branch.

![]({% asset_path 60-gh-pages/gh-branches-3.png %})

--

Happy with the result? Merge branches.

## Going live

--

Don't want your website on Google? Add this in your `<head>` :

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
```

--

Open your Github interface

--

Create a new branch and call it "gh-pages".

![]({% asset_path 60-gh-pages/gh-pages-1.png %})

--

Add a summary and click on "Commit & Sync".
![]({% asset_path 60-gh-pages/gh-pages-2.png %})

--

Go to your browser and enter this url:

`yourusername.github.io/yourprojectname`

## Issues

- Wait 5 minutes, it is not always instantaneous.

- Still not working? Check if there is capital letters, white spaces or special characters in your user name and / or in your project name.

- Again? Did you validate your e-mail address when you signed up in Github? If not, validate it.

- It works but you don't see your pictures anymore? Check if there is capital letters, white spaces or special characters in their names.
