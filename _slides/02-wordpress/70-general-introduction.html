  ++ : fully customisable, you can change everything.
  -- : time-consuming, need to have strong basis in PHP if you want to be happy with the result.

- ["light" version](http://www.wordpress.com): online! 100% free.
  ++ : effective. You concentrate on content. Many templates available.
  -- : the free version is very limited if you want to change the layout.
